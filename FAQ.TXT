Q: This isn't a mature product. Why did you publish it now?

A: The design has reached a level where it has the potential for 
   open hardware practitioners and DIYers to make impressive
   innovations with it.  It is released under an open hardware
   license in part to prevent patent restrictions from potentially
   foiling rapid advance of a new generation of technology.


Q: Why is this tv antenna design called "XO Halo"?

A: Because the design has primary elements that 
   resemble the union of a cross or plus sign and a halo.


Q: How can this work? It defies tested principles of electricity and physics.

A: No performance is expected when viewed in common domains of 
   electrical operation. The same can be said of many electrical 
   parts viewed outside of their conventional operating parameters.  
   This apparatus operates in the domain of high frequencies and direct, 
   inductive, and capacitive coupling. See documentation for 
   a detailed explanation.


Q: This antenna design does not work with my tv.

A: Since this is a new design, bugs and unknown limitations likely
   exist. Please read the rest of the FAQs for common techniques
   used to resolve some reception issues.
   If you continue to have issues, consider contacting the 
   manufacturer of your unit to report a possible bug, or 
   contact a tv antenna installer to obtain additional diagnostic 
   help.


Q: After automatic channel programming, one or more channels are missing 
   from the channel list.

A: Try power cycling the TV, manually choosing one of the missing channels,
   then re-programming the channel list. Some tv receivers select channels based
   on the channel selected just prior to programming.
   If a channel remains missing, try moving the antenna to where 
   the signal may be stronger such as on a window sill or above most
   objects in the room; Also consider moving the antenna further away 
   from objects that might emit signals that interfere such as 
   electrically powered devices --including the tv receiver.
   As with other indoor tv antennas, there is usually some compromise
   made between available channels and the antenna installation configuration
   such as position or orientation.
