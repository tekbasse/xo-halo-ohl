Abstract
========

This hardware design is a low-cost solution for building an indoor tv antenna using 75ohm coaxial cable. A wide-band balen is built into the antenna. The design reduces material construction costs and reduces overall physical profile while matching signal strength and quality of other indoor tv antenna profiles.
